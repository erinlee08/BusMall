# user story-8-31
as a dev-concern would be having the right code just so everything works it's supposed to. no redundancy.

as a user- would want to know how many times total I would need to click. app is fairly easy to use

as a marketing team-having a style that will catch user attention, easy of use.




#8-30 as a dev- first thing is to set up the basic structures. for example, an arry for images needs to be created, set up an object, event,
  and chart. what's also important is to arrange code in a way to makes sense with a good flow, for the easy of use. BUT for now, I am
  focused on getting the code done!

as a marketing team- would want to know what imgs have the most clicks and the least. the stats will be useful in determining what          
  to target and work on.

as a user- I would like to see how easy is it to use the site.
